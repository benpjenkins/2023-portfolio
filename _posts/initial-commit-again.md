## Welcome Back!
Welcome back, as you can see if you read my last post none of that really happened.  Life happened, a new job started, my hosting provider did some concerning things that made me take the site down for a while, etc...


## What's new?
I felt like it would be useful to have some kind of presence at this site.  I'm honestly not sure how often I'll post but here are the two buckets of things that are interesting to me at the moment.


Sharing useful ways in which I have been using generative AI in my day to day work.  Expect a post at some point about how I like to construct the beginnings of complex SQL queries by describing some things to an LLM and iterating through it in a conversational way until I have an initial structure I'm happy with.


I'm also looking to start working on a Discord clone, tentatively called "Strife".  Some friends and I have joked since Discord recently announced that they are going public that we probably have one good year left before it starts getting worse.  As a thought exercise and a way to start generating some code samples which I can share publicly I thought it would be useful to try and make an app which implemented many of the same features.  I don't have any plans to actually distribute it beyond maybe my close friends if it really takes shape but I will make that repo public and share my learnings along the way here.
